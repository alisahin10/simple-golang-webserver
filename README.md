# Golang Web Application
This project is a web application built with Golang using the GoFiber framework. It includes user management and authentication (auth) modules. The primary focus of this application is user registration, authentication (with JWT tokens), and managing user profiles. User data is stored in a local .db file using the Tidwall/buntdb library, which is a lightweight and embeddable key/value store.

## Features
User registration with validation.
User login with JWT token-based authentication.
Profile management (get and update user information).
Email-based user search.
JWT-based access and refresh tokens.
Local database storage using Tidwall/buntdb.

## Technologies Used
GoFiber: Web framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
BuntDB: An embeddable, in-memory key/value store with support for persistency.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication and session management.
SHA256: For password hashing.
Fiber middleware: For error handling, logging, and routing.

cd golang-web-app

```



Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the necessary Go dependencies:
```
go mod tidy
```

Configure the .env file: Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the environment variables:
```
LOCAL_DB_PATH=./data/buntdb.db
```

Run the Application: Start the application with:
```
go run main.go
```
